want to rotate imagesðŸŒ€

a picture taken with a smartphone could have an EXIF *orientation* tag that rotates the image by 90Â°.

when such photos are imported with `READ PICTURE FILE`, the orientation is ignored, which may result in an image rotated by 90Â° or 270Â°.

the status can be verified with the following code:

```4d
var $orientation : Integer
GET PICTURE METADATA($image; TIFF orientation; $orientation)
```

### SVG

the SVG component can rotate any image by any angle.

shift the rotated image to crop the margins created as result of changing dimension.

see [code](https://github.com/miyako/4d-topic-rotate-image/blob/main/rotate/Project/Sources/Methods/rotate.4dm).

### OpenCV plugin

SVG can be used to "correct" such images, but affine transforms are computationally expensive.

since we are only interested in 90Â° or 270Â° rotations, it may be better to use pixel displacement for performace.
